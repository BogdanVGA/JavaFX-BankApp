Final project for the "JavaFX Master Class: Create A Banking Application" course on Udemy.

The project aims to build a didactic *not a real life :)* banking app.
It implements Admin and User roles and uses a sqlite database for data persistence.
The app is structured according to the Model View Controller design model.
The views were created using .fxml files, styled with CSS.
It implements a simple authentication mechanism using a username and a password,
with different functionalities enabled according to user role (admin or simple user).
The users have two accounts - one checking account and one savings account.
The users can send/receive money to other users or they can transfer money between their two accounts.
The admin can create/delete new clients and can modify the balance of user's accounts.
